# ps-cfw-updater
PowerShell script to update Hekate and Atmosphere installations on CFW Switch SD cards

Usage: `powershell.exe -file Update-Cfw.ps1` and follow the prompts

**Please note** - if you are upgrading from a pre-1.0.0 version of Atmosphere, you will either need to clean your sysmodules (option `[m]` on the second menu), or you will need to manually update [ldn_mitm](https://github.com/spacemeowx2/ldn_mitm).
